#### Introduction

A DENSENET MODEL HAS BEEN TRAINED ON THE TRASHBOX DATASET TO PERFORM THE WASTE DETECTION AND CLASISFY THE RUBBISH MATERIALS.

WE ARE ACHIEVEING AN ACCURACY 88% ON A WIDE VARIETY OF GARBAGE WHICH IS PRESENT 

HOW THE TRAINING WAS DONE 

WE MADE THE USE OF DENSENET AND THEN DEVELOPED THE MODEL FROM SCRATCH AND THEN RUN THE MODEL FOR 20 EPOCHS WHICH HELPS US ACHIEVE THIS ACCURACY

## DATASET

WE HAVE USED A TRASHBOX DATASET WHICH WE SOURCED THROUGH GITHUB AND IT HAD 7 TYPES OF CLASSES IN IT https://github.com/nikhilvenkatkumsetty/TrashBox.git


##USING YOLOv5
FOR CLASSIFYING MULTIPLE WASTE OBJECTS WE HAVE GONE WITH THE APPROACH OF YOLOv5 SO THAT WE CAN DETECT THE OBJECTS PERFECTLY.


## DEPLOYMENT

WE HAVE DEPLOYED THE MODEL USING FLASK AND WE HAVE MADE THE FRONTEND USING HTML CSS AND JS

RUNNING FLASK
 OPEN TERMINAL
 NAGIVATE TO THE REPOSITORY
 INSIDE THE REPO RUN flask--app app run

FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF YOLOv5 MODEL WE HAVE USED ROBOFLOW TO PROVIDE THE REAL TIME CAPTURING FROM THE WEBCAM.
